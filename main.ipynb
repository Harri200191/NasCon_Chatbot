The whole new Nokia's G21 6GB landed with a Unisoc T606 (12 nm) chipset with the combination of a powerful Octa-core (2 x 1.6 GHz Cortex-A75 + 6 x 1.6 GHz Cortex-A55) CPU to increase the performance and speed. After that, with the new Nokia G21's 6GB, you will have 4GB of RAM with 128 GB of internal memory and also a dedicated memory card slot. The rumours about the Nokia G21 6GB suggest that it is going to be stable in the market as compared to its previous models since it comes with a triple camera system of 50 MP (wide) + 2 MP (macro) + 2 MP (depth) sensors, allowing users to experience another level of photography. On the front of the Nokia G21 6GB's a Sharp 8 MP selfie sensor to capture your beautiful moments with quality. The main attraction of the new Nokia's G21 6GB is its massive 6.5-inchÂ\\xa0IPS LCD capacitive touchscreen display, which looks very premium with its 720 x 1600 pixels resolution and 90 Hz refresh rate. The newly introduced G21Â\\xa06GB's a 5050 mAh battery pack that could last up to the whole day on just a single charge, and with the support of 18 Watts fast charging, it will be filled in aÂ\\xa0couple of minutes. With the announcement of the launch of the G21 6GB by Nokia, it is clear that Nokia is back in the market and attempting to recapture the position, which might not be advantageous for other brands such as Samsung.\"}"
